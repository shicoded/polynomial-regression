# polynomial-regression
This repository demonstrates how polynomial regression works using both a simple example with synthetic data and a real-world example for training and testing a polynomial regression model. It contains examples of generating quadratic data, transforming the data into polynomial features, fitting a linear regression model, and visualizing the results using Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

  ## Overview

Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable `X` and the dependent variable `Y` is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. This repository includes:
1. A simple example to explain polynomial regression with synthetic data.
2. A real-world example to train and test a polynomial regression model.

## Project Structure

`Step 1: Generate X Values`

`Step 2: Generate Y Values`

`Step 3: Plot the Data`

`Step 4: Transform Input Features to Polynomial Features`

`Step 5: Fit a Linear Regression Model to the Polynomial Features`

`Step 6: Predict Y Values Using the Fitted Model`

`Step 7: Plot the Synthetic Data Points and the Fitted Polynomial Curve`


**`Important NOTE:`** 

**Using these 7 methods helps you decide whether Polynomial Regression is needed to model your data. Here is a brief explanation of each method and why it's used:**

- `Visual Inspection`
  **Scatter Plot:** To get an initial sense of the data's behavior./ /
  **Linear Patterns:** To determine if a simple linear model can explain the relationship./ /
  **Non-linear Patterns:** To identify if a more complex model, like polynomial regression, is needed.
  
-`Residual Analysis`
    **Residual Plot:** To check the accuracy of the model's predictions./ /
    **Random Scatter:** To confirm if the model's assumptions hold true./ /
    **Patterned Residuals:** To detect any systematic errors indicating non-linearity.
    
- `Model Comparison`
    **Fit Models:** To see which model better captures the data's behavior./ /
    **Performance Metrics:** To quantitatively assess model fit and prediction accuracy./ /
    **Improvement:** To ensure the chosen model significantly improves prediction quality.
  
- `Cross-Validation`
    **K-Fold CV:** To evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data./ /
    **Validation Scores:** To ensure model consistency and reliability across different data splits./ /
    **Consistent Improvement:** To confirm that the polynomial model is consistently better.
  
- `Hypothesis Testing`
    **ANOVA:** To statistically compare the models./  /
    **Significant Improvement:** To validate the necessity of a more complex model./ /
- `Information Criteria`

    **AIC/BIC:** To balance model fit and complexity./  /
    **Lower AIC/BIC:** To prefer the model that best explains the data with the least complexity.//
- `Domain Knowledge`

    **Understanding Relationships:** To align the model with theoretical or empirical expectations.//
    **Practical Implications:** To ensure the model is practical and meaningful in the context of the problem domain.//
By addressing these points, you ensure a thorough evaluation of whether Polynomial Regression is needed, balancing complexity, accuracy, and practicality.
